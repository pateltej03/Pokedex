# 🧭 Pokedex

A visually rich, interactive Pokédex app built with SwiftUI. This app was developed for CMPSC 475 at Penn State and explores core SwiftUI concepts such as lists, navigation, data modeling, persistence, and user experience design. It presents Pokémon data in a clean, modular layout and allows users to track which Pokémon they've captured.
